</span><i>Chairman of the Board of Managers &amp; CEO</i><span class="s4"> <br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Thank you, Michael, and thanks to each of you for joining our call and for your ongoing support of the company. It's only been slightly over a month since our last earnings call, so our comments will be relatively brief this afternoon. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Probably the most important operational development to occur since our last call was the implementation of HB 123 in our home state of Ohio in late April. As we've previously shared with you, we believe the economics and lending structures available under this statute are untenable for our organization. As a result, we are not pursuing direct lending and ceased offering the services of CSO in Ohio. From a timing standpoint, the impact of these changes are not yet reflected in our Q1 financials. This should be more evident in Q2 and through the balance of this year. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>As expected, we're seeing customers displaced in the Ohio market as lenders exit or explore alternative models. Our CSO revenue will begin to decrease over the year as the existing portfolio of CSO customers runs off. We're obviously disappointed in this outcome both for our company and for our Ohio consumers, many of whom who will unfortunately face limited and oftentimes inferior options when trying to meet their credit needs. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>I am, however, pleased with how our organization has remained focus on serving this underbanked customer. It's what our customers have come to expect, and this is what we do well. We do have a third-party lender who is accepting loan applications from our customer base, and based on its underwriting and if approved, is offering a sub-36% APR line of credit under Ohio's General Loan Law. We do not receive any economics from the lender. However, we're hopeful that this offering, made available through our retail stores, will help us attract customer traffic and give us the opportunity to sell our other Money Service Business offerings. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Our objective will be to have other lenders seek to join this evolving marketplace and collectively attract our previous and potentially new customers, driving traffic to our branches and benefiting our customers through expanding their credit options. This is an exciting development for the company and one we hope will be foundational to the future strategies we employ across America. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>From a performance standpoint, in a time of tremendous transition, we successfully expanded both our operating contribution and our operating margin this quarter. I'll have Michael focus on those details, and then I'll close with some additional comments on legislative events. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span><b>Michael J. Durbin</b><span class="s4"> <br>
</span><i>Executive VP, Chief Administrative Officer, CFO &amp; Treasurer</i><span class="s4"> <br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Thank you, Ted. Consistent with our last call, I will not distinguish between predecessor and successor company but will focus my comments on the full year pro forma performance. I'll also highlight reporting changes resulting from the 2018 deleveraging transaction as well as the early adoption of ASU 2016-02, which relates to lease accounting. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>From a headline standpoint, as Ted indicated, operational performance during the quarter was sound. While revenue was down slightly versus Q1 of last year, this was a function of a lower portfolio entering the quarter. Improved provision for loan losses combined with lower operating and corporate expense levels resulted in an expansion of margin and core profitability over the quarter. We had a solid quarter, which was in line with our expectations. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>We entered 2019 with portfolios inclusive of CSO receivables as if on balance sheet, down 17.5% compared to the beginning of the prior year. Portfolios seasonally contracted during the quarter. However, the contraction experienced in Q1 of this year was only 8% as compared with 21.1% portfolio contraction experienced in Q1 of 2018. The reduced portfolio levels resulted in negative revenue variance of 1.3% versus the prior year. However, when viewing linked-quarter change, the Q1 2019 revenue was 3% reduced from Q4 2018 versus Q1 2018 which experienced a 12.3% linked-quarter reduction in revenue. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Short-term lending revenue experienced a negative revenue variance of 4% as compared to Q1 2018. This was partially due to a product shift in the Tennessee market towards a line of credit offering coupled with a reduced short-term Internet portfolio entering the year. Medium-term loan revenue also reported an unfavorable variance of 4.4% as compared to the same period last year. This reflects a 21.7% year-over-year decline in our gross medium-term portfolio, particularly in the Internet segment of the business. Recall that through fiscal year 2018, we proactively moderated new installment customer acquisition, allowing portfolios to attrit, providing a release of liquidity through the year. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Credit service fee revenue reported a negative variance of 5.7% as compared to Q1 2018. Internet was the primary contributor to this negative variance. Check cashing revenue reported a favorable variance of 7.1% on a year-over-year basis, benefiting from an increase in average fee per check moving from $15.59 to $18.28, an increase of 17.3%. Other income generated a positive year-over-year variance of 20.8%. This was primarily driven by an increase in commissions earned on our prepaid card services. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Reviewing our segment reporting, the retail segment reported a favorable revenue variance of 4.4% or $3.2 million. Provision for loan losses in the retail segment increased from 21.4% in Q1 2018 to 22.7% in Q1 of 2019. However, the primary driver of the net bad debt increase was a composition change in the Ohio CSO product. As compared to Q1 of 2018, the mix of our CSO receivable exposure has shifted towards medium term, necessitating higher reserves and resulting in higher reported provision for loan losses. As a point of reference, looking at Note 2 of our Q1 financial statements, the Q1 2019 medium-term provision for third-party lender losses was $3 million or 22.1% of the $13.4 million medium-term CSO receivable portfolio compared to the short-term provision of $2.9 million or 14.1% on the $20.5 million of short-term CSO receivables. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Operating gross profit in the retail segment was down slightly. However, the reduction was caused by a $6 million increase in operating, depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the fair value adjustment recording for property leasehold improvements and equipment due to the 2018 deleveraging transaction. Excluding this change, Q1 2019 operating gross profit would have outperformed Q1 2018. From a store count standpoint, we ended the quarter with 471 stores as compared to 484 (sic) [ 489 ] stores at the end of Q1 2018, a reduction of 2.7%, the result of closing or consolidating underperforming locations. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Turning to the Internet segment. The Internet segment was the primary contributor to portfolio contraction and as a result, recorded an unfavorable revenue variance of $4.3 million or 29.2%. Provision for loan losses in the Internet segment improved from 47.2% in Q1 2018 to 38.4% in Q1 of 2019. Provision for loan losses in the quarter benefited from improved fraud detection tools, a shift in mix from medium-term to short-term loan products and the release of reserves associated with the medium-term portfolio contraction. While the portfolio contraction and the resultant revenue reduction negatively impacted contribution, we achieved favorable margin expansion in the Internet segment with operating income margin increasing from 42.4% in Q1 of 2018 to 50.8% in Q1 of 2019. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Turning back to consolidated performance and our allowance for loan losses. Per my comments on the fiscal year-end conference call, as you review Footnote 2 in the financial statements, recall that the period-over-period comparison is distorted due to the fair value of the receivables as they transitioned from the predecessor company to the successor company in the deleveraging transaction. This is particularly evident in the allowance for medium-term receivables. Effective at the close of the deleveraging transaction, this reserve went to 0 with the reserves being incorporated into the revaluing of the assets. Since that time, as the medium-term portfolio changes and new loans are added into the portfolio at their face value, this reserve number expands accordingly. The Q4 to Q1 reserve increase related to medium-term receivables reflects this expansion. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Total consolidated operating expenses, excluding provision, appear to have increased year-over-year. This again is distorted by the increase in depreciation and amortization related to the restructuring, rising from $2.2 million to $8.2 million. All other operating expense categories reported favorable year-over-year comparisons. Excluding provision and depreciation and amortization, operating expenses were reduced from $35.6 million in Q1 of 2018 to $33.7 million in Q1 of 2019. The decrease can be attributed to the closure of underperforming locations coupled with several successful cost containment initiatives. Reported operating income of $23.3 million in Q1 2019 fell from $27.2 million in Q1 of 2018. However, this reduction is caused by the change in depreciation and amortization resulting from the deleveraging transaction. Excluding the change, Q1 2019 operating income exceeded that of Q1 2018. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>We also reported another favorable year-over-year comparison in core corporate expenses. Core corporate expenses has reduced from $20 million in Q1 of 2017 to $17.6 million in Q1 of 2018 to $16.6 million in Q1 of 2019. We ended the quarter with $75.1 million in cash on our balance sheet, a decrease of $14.6 million compared to the same quarter last year. This year-over-year change is principally the result of the capital restructuring efforts undertaken through 2018. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Finally, on the implications of applying a couple of accounting standards. First, as noted in our last call, we applied ASC 805 business combination accounting, which required us to determine the fair values of our primary assets and liabilities pursuant to the deleveraging transaction in December of last year. The first account line impacted by this exercise was property, leasehold improvements and equipment. Pursuant to ASC 805, these assets were evaluated for their fair value to determine the appropriate accounting for the successor company's opening balance sheet. While the predecessor company's balance sheet had been depreciated to $26.8 million as of fiscal year 2017, the successor company's balance sheet carries these assets at their fair value of $61.8 million. The larger balance resulted in the large increase in Q1 2019 depreciation and amortization expense compared to Q1 of 2018, with the resulting impact of a lower Q1 2019 operating income compared to Q1 2018. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>Second, we elected early adoption of the FASB-issued ASU 2016-02 related to recognizing lease contracts with greater than 12 months as a right of use asset and a corresponding finance lease liability. As a result of this adoption, on January 1, 2019, we recorded $34.2 million for both operating lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets. I encourage you to read the footnotes and disclosure provided for a full understanding of these accounting changes. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>And now, I will turn the call back to Ted Saunders. <br>

</span>Thank you, Michael. Yes, I really commend all of our operators and our leadership team on a strong quarter. And while we're all remaining focused on serving our customers, we also pay close attention and remain engaged on prospective changes that might affect us from the legislative front. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>As always, there are numerous items which could impact our industry being considered in statehouses around the country. There are 2 items which have recently passed out of the California assembly. Bill AB 39 requires on loans made under the California Financing Law, or CFL, with a bona fide principal amount of $2,500 or more a maximum simple interest rate of 36% plus the Fed funds rate, which is about 2.5%. The bill passed the full assembly on May 23, 2019. The bill is pending referral in the Senate where activity is expected in June as part of the proceedings of the Senate Banking Committee. If passed, the measure would be effective in January of 2020. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
</span>A second bill, AB 642, was directed at the lead generation market. It revises the definition of a broker and requires licensing of a broker prior to the point where a finance lender can compensate a broker for a customer referral. This bill passed the assembly and is awaiting a committee referral in the Senate. <br>
<span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>

</span>In Nevada, which is a state we only service on the Internet, SB201, this bill is currently awaiting action by the Nevada Governor. He's expected to sign the bill into law. The bill adopts certain provisions of the Military Lending Act and requires the commissioner of financial institutions to develop, implement and maintain a database for title loans, deferred deposit loans and other high-interest loans made to customers of the state. It will also prohibit making these loans if they would exceed 25% of the customer's expected gross monthly income. <br>

</span>In Oklahoma, which is another Internet-only state, SB 720 has passed the Oklahoma legislature and has been signed by the Governor. It'll become effective on 8/1/2020. The statute puts in place the Oklahoma Small Lenders Act, which permits higher-cost installment loans up to $1,500 with maturities not to exceed 12 months. The bill also includes a sunset provision of the existing [ pending ] loan statute. <br>

</span>Finally, in Arizona, the Center for Responsible Lending along with other Arizona-based consumer action groups have been approved by the Arizona Secretary of State to begin collecting signatures for a proposed ballot initiative that would limit the interest rate that may be charged on a car title loan to 36% APR. To qualify for the ballot, supporters of this measure would need to obtain 237,645 valid signatures. They must gather those signatures by July 2, 2020. If these requirements are met, the proposal would appear on the 2020 election ballot in Arizona. <br>

</span>At the federal level, the notice and comment period for the revised small-dollar loan rule, which was proposed by the CFPB, expired on May 15 of 2019. The bureau must now review all public comments received regarding the proposal and then release a final version of the rule. A final rule is not expected until sometime in 2020. <br>

</span>While a number of these state-level developments represent challenges, our organization's focus remains on serving its customers. Being a multiservice provider positions us with a number of levers to pull as we respond to these various challenges. In Ohio, we're moving to a marketplace-type business model, which is providing a new and different value proposition to our customers. As changes in some of these other markets unfold, we will continue to find ways to work with and serve our underbanked consumer. <br>
