\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Thank you, Kris. Good 
morning, and welcome to our Financial Analyst Day, both to the people here in the room and to those listening to us on our webcast. I'm excited to provide you an update on our progress over the last year, which has been very strong, and our plans to expan
d our leadership in the data-driven world. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
I have 3 items that I want to cover to give you context. The first, customers' business and IT priorities and the resulting market opportunity it creates for NetApp and how we plan to execute to capture the op
portunity that's expanding and in front of us. So let me begin by telling you more about what we see in our discussion with customers. The world is changing, and changing fundamentally, as we've said before. In every customer discussion that we are engage
d
 in, it is clear that there's a war for end customer acquisition as well as for talent and to increase the productivity and leverage in their business model. And over the last few years, we continue to see that pace of change accelerate. Customers are usi
n
g data and technology to drive the digital transformation of their business to expand value creation. Digital transformation is undoubtedly a key CEO priority in the preponderant majority of customers that we are in discussions with. And we are engaged in
 3 types of projects with those customers. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
The first is to use data and technology to reach customers in new ways using mobile phones or digital platforms. The second is to complement traditional physical products with digital software-enhanced product
s and services. And the third is to use data and technology to fundamentally improve the efficiency and productivity of businesses, either by improving the performance of the supply chain or reducing the cost and improving the cycle time and quality of cu
stomer-facing products and services. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
One of the things that NetApp undertook over the last year was to study what were the capabilities of the leaders in digital transformation. And to understand that, we partnered with a leading analyst firm, IDC, to 
survey more than 800 enterprises to assess their capabilities to accelerate digital transformation. And what we found, as a result of that analysis, was that those companies that have capable data management infrastructures, tools and organizational capab
i
lity to be data-driven, that is to use data to fundamentally accelerate the way that they deliver new products, operate their businesses and deliver value to shareholders substantially outperform those that are laggards in the use of data. So data-driven 
companies are able to substantially outperform those that are laggards. And so we see this as an end state for every enterprise that is looking to transform itself digitally to be data-driven. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 But that isn't the reality of most IT departments today. In
 fact, as Jean will tell you later, only a small fraction of the customers that we surveyed really can consider themselves truly data-driven today. Most IT departments are faced with these 3 challenges. Tight budgets, especially traditional IT infrastruct
u
res and traditional ways of doing IT are continuing to be compressed. The second is skill gaps. Relative to the capabilities that are available from a technology or device or software perspective, IT department skill sets and ability to consume those tech
n
ologies is substantially challenged. And finally, it goes without saying that in most businesses, the IT department is seen as constraining the pace of innovation. Businesses are increasingly looking beyond IT to accelerate the pace of transformation of t
heir business. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Not only that, we just talked about every CEO wanting their company to be data-driven, so that they can accelerate digital transformation. IT is challenged along the 3 dimensions shown, but also needs to respond with a modern data manage
ment infrastructure to be able to provide the business capabilities that they require to be data-driven. So these are the imperatives that result for IT leaders that are looking to use IT to transform business. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 It goes without saying that every custom
er in the world is looking to harness the innovation that is available in the public cloud. The leading hyperscaler cloud providers are investing enormous sums of money to deliver pre-integrated innovation to customers. And no business leader will allow t
heir IT department to not be able to take advantage of that. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
The second, to deal with the gaps in skill sets and with the reduction in the amount of expertise that IT has. IT departments are increasingly looking to deploy pre-integrated converged and h
yperconverged systems to accelerate time to capability, time to new service delivery and also to be able to operate those highly automated infrastructures using generalists rather than specialists. So we see hyperconverged and converged systems growing as
 a percentage of the total market. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
And finally, to reduce the cost and improve standardization of their IT estate, IT infrastructures are being replaced. The legacy custom-siloed IT infrastructures that were promoted by our competitors are increasingly
 replaced by modern, standardized, all-flash array building blocks that radically improve the total cost of ownership and enable customers to simplify the operations of their overall IT department to fund the transformational initiatives that IT wants to 
take on. So these are the imperatives that, in turn, drive market opportunity for NetApp. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Let me start by saying not only do we have capable technology in each of those IT imperatives, market-leading technology that has allowed us to gain share and exp
and the range of buying centers and problems that we address within the customers with new total addressable market, but we, in addition, uniquely in the industry, allow customers to be able to have a highly integrated, simplified and performant data mana
g
ement solution called the NetApp Data Fabric that allows our customers to onboard with NetApp in any of these IT imperatives, but be able to achieve an end state that no one else in the industry is able to offer them. The Data Fabric is winning on-premise
s. It's winning on the biggest hyperscaler clouds. And it's winning in every part of the world that we compete in. It is the source of competitive advantage and differentiation that positions us uniquely for success in the market today. \line }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So now let me t
ell you about the market opportunity that those IT imperatives translate into. These imperatives create opportunity on-premises that is within the enterprise data center and on the cloud. And we will tell you how we are accelerating growth with solutions 
that lead those markets, allow us to capture growing market share and to expand our total addressable market. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
NetApp plays in a large and growing market and is overweight in the growth segments of the market, taking share and expanding our total addressable market. Let me go through the details. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  
\line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Our total addressable market is comprised of 3 segments. The blue represents the network storage market, which is declining -- which is large, but declining at the rate of 4% CAGR over the next 3 years. We 
are expanding our total addressable market with hyperconverged, which grows at the rate of 29% over the next 3 years and cloud storage, which is a large market and growing at the rate of 13%. These segments are aligned with the 3 customer IT imperatives t
h
at I just described: the blue predominantly aligned with the modernization imperative; the gray aligned along with converged systems to the imperative to build clouds; and the green is the segment that's focused on customers being able to leverage the inn
ovation that's available in the public clouds. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So let me tell you a little bit more about each of these. The network storage market, this is our traditional market where we have played. Although declining in aggregate, network storage represents an opp
ortunity for NetApp. We have clear market leadership in the network attached storage segment. We are consistently taking market share in the SAN market. And we are innovating to capture new workloads, like artificial intelligence and machine learning, whi
ch are built to run on net -- on NFS, a market that we are, without question, the leader in. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Now let me tell you a bit more in details of what's happening under the covers of that large blue number. When you look at the details, you see that subsegment
s of this market are growing very quickly, and we have already pivoted our investment to lead in those growth segments. So if you look at the overall network storage market, which excludes direct attached storage, the disk -- hard disk drive-based segment
 
is shrinking. But the all-flash array segment, representing the light blue at the bottom of this chart, is growing substantially at about 21% CAGR. We are clearly outpacing competitors in the all-flash arrays and winning new customers and new workloads in
 
existing customers. More than 50% of our configured systems revenue comes from all-flash arrays. Our market share in flash is greater substantially than it was in the disk-based business segment. And it demonstrates the strength of our position in the all
-
flash array market. And as that market grows to be a bigger part of the overall storage market positions us as well to capture aggregate market share gains in the overall market. Not only that, as new workloads get created, like artificial intelligence an
d machine learning, these workloads run on high-performance NFS systems. And we are very, very well positioned with our leadership in all-flash arrays and NFS to be able to capture those new workloads, whether they run on-premises or in the public cloud. 
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
In addition to all-flash arrays, let's talk about converged infrastructure. We said that customers dealing with the fact that they no longer have as many skilled specialized IT resources increasingly want to buy pre-integrated building blocks of server 
and storage pre-integrated together in the form of a converged system. Converged infrastructure is a large market today, about $9 billion, and continues to grow over the next 3 years to about $10 billion. We are a longstanding leader in the converged infr
astructure market with the FlexPod solution. And we have expanded our footprint with new partnerships. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Over the last year, we have consistently and substantially outpaced the converged infrastructure market. The latest share results show that NetApp is
 performing an order of magnitude better than any of the other vendors in the converged infrastructure market. And we feel extraordinarily well positioned, as the industry continues to churn for our competitors. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Now let me talk about a net new market,
 which represents an expansion of our total available market. Hyperconverged infrastructure is seeing adoption within the enterprise as a simplified rapid time to value solution for standardized environments, virtualized, standardized, automated environme
n
ts, where customers want to replicate within their own data centers the experience that their end customers would benefit from on the public cloud. A good part of the growth in hyperconverged infrastructure is going to come from the enterprise customer se
g
ment, where we feel very, very well positioned with our differentiated approach and with an architecture that is set to scale to meet the requirements of the enterprise segment. We are off to a strong start in this market. And we have every confidence tha
t
, like we have done in the all-flash array market, with an enterprise-grade hyperconverged infrastructure solution, we will be able to capture share and be a substantial player in this part of the market. Brad Anderson will tell you more about the details
 of our attack plan for this part of the market. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
And finally, the public cloud. The bar charts here represent the size of the cloud storage and systems hardware market that the big hyperscaler cloud providers are deploying today. The word ODM refers to
 original design manufacturers, that is entities like Foxconn and Quanta who develop storage systems, hardware storage systems for the hyperscalers. And it represents the growing impact of the public cloud as a platform for deploying IT. Much of the growt
h in public cloud is coming from net new workloads being created on the cloud, that is cloud-native workloads and, selectively, the migration of some enterprise workloads, like collaboration or business intelligence to the public cloud. \line }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 On top of those
 storage systems is a category that we are targeting. The light green chart bars here represents the value of software and storage and data management software services that we are creating on top of the systems that the cloud providers have. Just like in
 
the enterprise data center, we deliver software value on top of our storage systems. In the public cloud, we are excited to expand our total addressable market by delivering the value of NetApp software on top of the storage systems and hardware that the 
h
yperscalers have as cloud data services. The hyperscalers not only need this technology to meet the requirements of their end customers, as Anthony Lye will tell you, but they also afford us a vast distribution channel that allows us to reach new customer
s and new buying centers in a very cost-efficient manner. And not only are we establishing an undisputedly clear leadership position in this market, we know that leading with the cloud positions us extraordinarily well across our entire portfolio. \line }
{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Over
 the last few months, we've studied the leads that we have generated from leading with the cloud-first conversation with our customers. Of every 100 new opportunities that starts with the conversation in the cloud, 74 of them translate into wins on-premis
es, as well. So the cloud opportunity is multiplicative across our entire portfolio and positions us uniquely in the industry. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So let me close by giving you a perspective about what our customers' IT environments will look like in the next few years. W
e believe that it will be a multi-cloud and hybrid cloud world, multi-cloud because every customer we talk to uses multiple cloud services. Whether they are from hyperscaler Infrastructure as a service or Software-as-a-Service, every large customer that w
e
 talk to is using multiple cloud providers today. If you look at the percentage of our cloud customers, the number of those that started with a single cloud is now changing dramatically to include multiple clouds, as every organization wants to lock thems
elves into the opportunity that all of the cloud providers have, not just a single one. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
The second is hybrid, meaning that there is not going to be applications only on the public cloud, but most customers today, for the foreseeable future, will have a
pplications that run in their own data center or in a private data center that they rent from someone else. And what the customers will need is the ability to not only be capable in those different platforms, but also to integrate them, so that data manag
ement across all of these landscapes is simplified and capable. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
And NetApp is helping our customers accelerate their data-driven digital transformation with flash-empowered, multi-cloud connected storage systems and software, simplify and automate thei
r data centers with software-defined converged and hyperconverged systems and, uniquely in the industry, integrate all of those landscapes, the data in all of those landscapes with consistent, proven NetApp Data Fabric. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 That summarizes the market opportunity that enables us to win with customers. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Now I want to tell you a little bit about how we are transforming to execute against the market opportunity. Let me define transformation. Transformation is making fundamental change in how a business is 
-- operates to create a substantial step change in a company's performance and health in response to or anticipation of market shifts. And we have executed excellently across all aspects of our business. We continue to make fundamental changes in the inno
v
ation portfolio to focus it against a growing set of expanding markets, in the go-to-market organization to capture market share as well as to access new customers in new ways; in the operational rigor, in which we conduct our business, to afford improvin
g
 gross margins as well as operating margins, delivering a leveraged business model; and in talent and culture to build a culture of excellence and a leadership team that, we think, is the best in the industry. You'll get to meet our leaders today. And as 
you leave here, I'm sure you will reflect the same sentiment that I have. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Our results from transformation, which we undertook, are phenomenal. I couldn't be more proud of a chart than this one. Comparing Q1 to Q3 of fiscal '17 with Q1 to Q3 of fiscal y
ear '18, we have shown enormous and consistent progress against our business model. Revenue growth, product revenue growth, strategic product revenue growth, mature product revenue growth have all been substantially better year-on-year than the prior year
. Operating margins have expanded substantially, as have earnings per share, representing the disciplined approach to investment and the leverage in our business model. The transformation of NetApp has driven exceptional results. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 And underpinning it is
 the real leadership that we have in all of the categories in our portfolio, established leadership in the largest categories: the most intellectually demanding categories in the storage industry, the #1 storage and data management operating system, not o
n
ly for the enterprise, but increasingly for the hyperscaler clouds; the #1 in storage and device management software, the software that allows customers to gain insight into their data centers; and increasingly, the #1 for a variety of the cloud technolog
i
es that are being deployed; accelerating momentum with market share gains in the fastest-growing parts of the storage market, taking share by disrupting the tired legacy solutions of our competitors across the board; and uniquely in the industry, among al
l
 of the vendors in the market, chosen by the world's leading hyperscaler clouds. For us, unlike for most other players in the market, the public cloud is a growing and expanding opportunity for our customers and, in turn, for NetApp, accelerating momentum
, establish leadership, uniquely positioned for advantage in the market. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So now let me tell you a little bit about how we are going to execute against our opportunity. We have, through the transformation of NetApp, brought on focused leaders to drive e
ach of these IT imperatives, and you will hear from them. We've also fine-tuned our go-to-market, so that we have laser focus against capturing these opportunities. We recognize that the pursuit of some of these opportunities requires us to talk to new de
c
ision-makers and customers and reach them in new ways. And Henri Richard and Jean English will tell you about that. And finally, Ron will tell you about how the discipline in our business model and the winning portfolio that we have allows us to translate

Good morning. Thank you, George. Good morning. I'm Joel Reich, and it's an honor to be here again this year. Last year, I talked about how we were reinventing our innovation engine for the next era of IT. And this year, I'm excited to share our progress. 
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So George talked about digital transformation and how it's driving new IT mandates. And I meet with customers nearly 
every day, and they're all undertaking these 3 imperatives at the same time across different parts of their businesses. And our ability to help them address all 3 with a cohesive and connected portfolio really resonates with them. In the next hour, you're
 going to hear detail about each of the 3 imperatives. For my discussion, I'll focus in on how we're helping our customers modernize their IT architectures with cloud-connected flash. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  
\line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So what's driving a modernization mandate? Every customer is under p
ressure to drive efficiency, optimize their IT operations and free resources to fund transformation. They need to accelerate the performance and drive efficiencies for their existing applications, for example, refreshing and consolidating their old tired 
S
AN architectures, scaling and managing data growth and protecting data across the hybrid cloud. And at the same time, they have to support new diverse workloads, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, containers and big data analytics and k
now SQL databases. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Now a big part of modernizing is moving to flash-based storage. This trend is a huge opportunity for us. It opens the door for NetApp, maybe for the first time in our history to become #1 in the biggest, fastest-growing market in sto
rage. Now while flash is a big part of modernizing, we don't think it's enough. We believe there are many characteristics required to modernize IT. To be a leader and a key strategic vendor, you have to do them all, things like cloud connectivity to innov
a
te in the cloud; software-defined storage for flexibility and how to consume storage; simplicity and efficiency to optimize operations; and intelligence to drive greater customer intimacy and data center automation. All of these are important characterist
ics of any flash solution that truly modernizes IT infrastructure. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
We have compelling, competitive advantages in all of these areas. But today, I'm going to focus on just the first 3. The most important, in our view, is cloud connected. Our cloud-first
 strategy resonates with our customers. We're continuing to enrich cloud connectivity through ONTAP software innovation, and that innovation is central to our differentiation in the cloud. With NetApp, customers get the most cloud-connected flash solution
 in the industry. It future-proofs them. It reduces risks. They can seamlessly connect to the world's largest public clouds and integrate their data across a hybrid cloud environment with common data services. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So we already touched on the importance of
 flash and modernization initiatives. Our All Flash FAS is the top-performing enterprise storage system measured in independent benchmarks. And it's unified, meaning it has all of the protocols that allow customers to take all of their applications and ac
c
elerate mixed workloads in a single data operating system. They can consolidate and refresh their SAN and high-performance engineering applications and support new deep learning in hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions on to
 
a single architecture. And they can run their entire hybrid cloud ecosystem with common data management. That gives them operational simplicity, right? That gives them leverage and skills. And new flash innovations are emerging. We're just in the beginnin
g
 of this market. The giants in the industry, companies like Intel and Samsung and Toshiba and Broadcom, they're investing in new solid-state technologies and high-speed, low-latency networks that are going to drive flash adoption into places where it hasn
'
t been before. And we're partnering with these leaders on these new technologies. NVme and NVme over Fabrics, persistent memory and storage class memory all offer the promise of exceptional performance. And quad-level cell NAND could spell the demise of s
pinning disks. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
But these can't be treated as just new storage media. To give customers the full benefits of these technologies takes a holistic approach and a cohesive strategy across the storage, compute and networking stack. It requires a thoughtful 
approach to the entire application ecosystem. Our software-defined innovation gives us the ability to tune for the application ecosystem and optimize for customers. We believe that these disruptive technologies can and should be introduced nondisruptively
,
 not with the use of a forklift. Our vision is to offer continuous innovation. Just as we added All Flash FAS nondisruptively, we'll add NVme over Fabric. We'll add next-generation solid-state and storage-class memory and persistent memory in the server, 
so that customers can embrace these emerging technologies with confidence and reduced risk. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Customers increasingly want to consume capabilities and services in different ways. That's why software-defined is a very strong requirement in this space. And 
our history of software innovation gives us an unequaled ability to deliver flexible choice to customers. And the Data Fabric capabilities to span the portfolio, to span the hybrid cloud are built in. That means customers get consistent and integrated dat
a management no matter how they prefer to consume across on-prem and cloud. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So let's take a look at an example of a customer who's modernizing with cloud-connected flash. NetApp won a fiercely competitive take-out at a Fortune 20 health care provider. 
Over 18 months, we've won 80% share in their data center with a SAN modernization initiative. And the results, after 12 months of migrating more than 10 petabytes to all-flash, are compelling. And I believe they show you how modernization, the scale of th
e
 return of investment funds new important initiatives. So they achieved $6.5 million in run rate savings, along with a 7,200 square-foot reduction in footprint and 500 kilowatts of data center power savings. At the same time, they improved their performan
c
e by 90% and got 10x the throughput performance. And with our storage efficiency capability, they got 3x better utilization with deduplication and compression than in their existing infrastructure. And their next move is to use the cloud capability that t
h
ey've gained with All Flash FAS to innovate in the public cloud. And obviously, you look at the savings that they've gotten, they've provided funding in order to do that by modernizing their infrastructure. There are hundreds of organizations like this, a
nd they're voting with their wallets. We were the fastest-growing of the top 5 flash vendors in calendar year 2017. We gained the most share of any vendor in calendar year 2017. And we continue to outpace the market. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 In our Run to NetApp campaign, whic
h is a competitive take-out campaign, we're seeing a 75% win rate versus EMC. That amounts to over 2 competitive displacements a day. And 33% of the SAN sales that we're getting in that program are new customer logos for us. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 We're winning in flash, an
d here's why. Our cloud-first strategy resonates strongly with customers. The operational efficiency and simplicity of our flash solutions free resources to fund customers' transformation initiatives. We provide the highest performance for mixed enterpris
e
 and emerging workloads, like AI and deep learning. And we future-proof customers' investments by delivering all the benefits of disruptive new flash technologies nondisruptively. And our ONTAP software innovation means customers can integrate their data 
and have common data management across their IT real estate, either on-premise or in the cloud. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712

\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Thank you, Joel. Good morning. Welcome. I'm Brad Anderson, and I'm very excited to be here. As the newest member of NetApp, I, too, have spent a lot of time saying, "Hey, is this the c
ompany I want to put a large personal and professional investment?" And what compelled me was that when I look at the shift to cloud, I think that's a huge opportunity, not a headwind. And NetApp, really, to me, stood out because it's the only company tha
t
's driving a cloud-first strategy. It has the simplest, most unified and differentiated line of a product from core to cloud. I found a absolutely committed leadership team, from George to sales to the lines of business, the BUs throughout the functional 
units. And I also found a large loyal customer base that really wants us to win. Having been here only 3 months, I am more bullish than I was back in December when I made the decision to join this team. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Joel talked about modernizing the data center. Ge
orge laid out the 3 imperatives. I'm focused on how are we going to help customers build clouds to accelerate services. How are we going to help customers build solutions on-prem to provide the same services and the same experiences that they expect from 
cloud? Specifically, I'm going to talk about the success in the enterprise we're having in our converged business. And I'm going to talk about our strategy and focus in an enterprise-class hyperconverged solution. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Let's start with converged. So George 
showed you that the network storage market is declining, but within that segment, there is a converged market that's growing at 3%. And while 3% is modest, that is a much larger opportunity for NetApp. We are consistently taking share in this space. In th
e IDC results just released yesterday for calendar Q4, we grew at 16% and the market grew at negative 3%. For all of calendar '17, we grew at 27% and the market was flat. Converged continues to be a huge opportunity and we're winning in that space. \line 
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So 
why are we winning? Because we took a very different approach than the others in the marketplace. So if you look at the traditional CI converged infrastructure solutions out there, they tend to be very rigid, fixed architectures for a limited upgradabilit
y
 capabilities. They're not necessarily some of -- best-of-breed parts and components. They tend to be focused on one app. If you want to do another app, you put in another converged systems so before long, you have silos of converged architecture out ther
e, not particularly efficient. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
On the other hand, the NetApp approach is a much more flexible architecture, best-of-breeds components on compute, on storage, on networking, very flexible, multi-OS, multi-hypervisor, multiprotocol, multitenant, multi-ap
plication. We have the largest application offerings validated and certified for ease of deployment and operation. And then if you want to consolidate multiple apps, you can get that in a single unified converged system to run mixed enterprise application
s and line of business applications. And they're all connected to the cloud. And so we are not trying to create a silo in anything, so there's a seamless on-ramp to cloud. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 We think this is a winning approach, and it shows in the results. We are approac
hing $2 billion annually, as reported by IDC. I share the Q4 numbers, but we are now, the fifth quarter in a row, the fastest-growing converged platform out there. We're taking share. Cumulatively, we have now shipped more than 4,000 petabytes, the larges
t of any of the converged vendors, and we're winning. The takeaway is NetApp's FlexPod provides customers a superior application experience, lower CapEx and OpEx and a faster time to solution. We are not letting up on this in calendar '18 or fiscal '19. 
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So what we're doing here is we're investing in more application areas. You're going to see SAP HANA, Epic Health care as a service, ITaaS as well as investing in more manning services and expanding our partnership. On March 26, we are now porting SKUs wi
th Fujitsu in EMEA, and so we're expanding that aggressively. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
We think there's a lesson here on what we did in converged that is very applicable to hyperconverged. So let's take a look at hyperconverged because we think this is very much a winning app
roach. So hyperconverged is the fastest-growing segment, except for cloud data services. And so it's growing at 29%. And despite the fact that we have only been shipping for about 4.5 months, the enterprise adoption is just now beginning to start. And so 
w
hen you look at that growth, our view is much of that future growth is going to be in the enterprise space, and that's where we're going to go focus. And we're going to take a lot of the lessons we have learned in converged and apply it to hyperconverged.
 So let's talk a little bit about that. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Very similarly, there's a pattern here. So what you kind of saw is a kind of a simplistic way on converged. We're seeing much of the early hyperconverged solutions out there taking a very simplified approach. The
y're on -- for their management, they were kind of focusing on deployment. Deployment is about a 1-day thing or a few hours. We focus on life cycle management. Our competition is focused on converged nodes. Think of a converged node as a server, and that'
s
 very simple. But the challenge of that is if you need more storage, you got to buy compute. If you need more compute, you got to buy storage. We take -- our approach is very different where we allow you to scale those independently as your workload deman
ds it, so you don't have to overprovision or strain resources that you don't otherwise need. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Traditional approach focuses typically on single applications and single applications and very simple deployments. And so what you mostly are seeing is small a
pps in SMB, SME-type enterprises or maybe if you see early enterprise adoption and maybe VDI. That's not the most demanding app out there. On the other hand, we're focused on enterprise-class scale because think of this as private cloud, people want to op
e
rate like a hypervisor, not like a small SME shop. And so our approach is full life cycle management, very efficient performance. You can scale it independently, but you can have cloud-like scale, multi-tenancy. And most importantly, where we're seeing tr
action is where do you want to run mixed workloads. And that's what you want to do in the cloud, that's what you want to do in your private cloud, that's what you want to do in HCI-based platform. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Now we think we're very well positioned in the enterpri
se with our technology because when we -- when you look at our hyperconverged offering, while we've only been shipping 4, 5 months, it's based on the SolidFire element OS. And between us and the SolidFire team before, they've been working on that for 7 ye
a
rs. And where were they targeting that platform? They were targeting that platform at the largest SPs, the most demanding service providers in the marketplace. And what are the requirements of the largest SPs? It is multi-tenancy. It is cloud-like scalabi
l
ity. It's the ability to run mixed loads. It's full life cycle management. It's high availability. That's what's we're bringing in our hyperconverged platform. And then, in addition to that, we add the global reach of our worldwide organization on sales, 
service and support. We think that's the winning combination, and with the Data Fabric cloud connectivity to the things that Anthony is doing and the things that Joel is doing. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 We're not just singly focusing on the product. We're focusing on the full e
nd-to-end go-to-market. On the marketing side, it's resonating. We're leading with cloud-first. In Data Fabric, we are targeting our messaging in programs and campaigns to a very new different set of buyers. The buyers of converged is very different than 
the buyers of kind of the core infrastructure. And we are investing heavily internally and through our partnership ecosystem of upraising our skills, our messages and our capabilities. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  
\line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 On the sales side, we're also making a number of investments and ch
anges. We're standing up a dedicated sales team globally focused on this imperative with very accountable sales leadership as well. We are hiring new skills, virtualization skills, cloud skills, people very much from the service provider community that ve
ry much experts and focused on the hyperconverged opportunities. We are expanding our channel, leveraging our CI channel, in particular, to go after this opportunity. And lastly, we're aligning our compensation -- sales compensation to this imperative. 
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
While it's very early, the results show, and we're very encouraged. We hit our first quarter number. Now that's a third quarter for us, but the first quarter of shipping. We are -- our proposition is very much resonating in the targeted workloads, the wor
kloads we're targeting, so large-scale virtualization workloads, private cloud workloads, service providers, DevOps. And so we're seeing traction in those kind of enterprise. We are having wins globally, so it's in all theaters. And we're seeing that it's
 both net new business as well as expanding share of wallet in our existing accounts. It's a new buying center in our existing accounts. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So let's look at a couple of customers who chose NetApp. I want to pick 2 of these. First one's Consultel Cloud, a 
large Australian service provider. And they basically wanted to offer hybrid cloud as a service. And they started with non-NetApp infrastructure. And they found that it couldn't scale. It could -- it was extremely expensive. And so they now offer it as HC
I
 as a service. They picked NetApp for all of those enterprise scalability, performance, mixed workloads because they're offering to a set of customers, they don't know what workloads are coming in. And they found, because of our decidedly enterprise-class
 
set of attributes that it was a superior solution to anything they looked at. As a result now, they can operate and they're operating this in Australia, Asia, U.K. and the U.S. They're able to operate this about 50% of the OpEx, CapEx of their previous im
plementations. And they're able to online a new customer into this hybrid cloud capability from 7 weeks to 4 weeks, a tremendous change in their model. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 The second one is Imperva. Imperva is a large cybersecurity company. They support some of the larges
t customers, both corporate and government, in about 100 countries. And as cybersecurity, that's got to be a 24/7 imperative. And so -- and they have cybersecurity developers globally to respond immediately to any threat. And so what they wanted was to, a
g
ain, a enterprise-class set of capabilities because they need to kind of emulate the infrastructure that their customers are running, but they wanted to put it very close to their development community, so they could be extremely responsive on the 7/24 th
i
ng. And so what really stood out was the enterprise-class set of capabilities, but ability -- the simplified operations of that, easy to deploy, but easy to manage because they didn't want any of their development community spending time operating the sys
tem. And so again, it was an enterprise set of attributes, performance as well as life cycle operation that had them choosing NetApp over other HCI providers in the marketplace. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 The other good thing is I want to make sure you realize that CI and HCI ar
e complementary and additive. They target very different buyers. CI appeals to the infrastructure buyer, allows them to buy a unified, tested, validated to run multiple enterprise and line of business applications. And they want to tune it. HCI appeals to
 
the cloud virtualization, people who just want to consume it like they consume cloud resources, but be able to scale and operate like a hyperscaler and have kind of mixed workloads and, in many cases, unpredictable workloads, and be able to pack those app
s
 very closely together and know because of our QoS that you can still get the kind of performance you need. Analysts think it's 80% of all customers are going to buy both. And our experience is they're buying both. I mean, this is not cannibalizing. This 
is a NetApp. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
It's not just CI and HCI. It's also cloud. Our customers need solutions across this full spectrum. And only NetApp provides enterprise-class CI, hyperconverged with seamless cloud connectivity. CI and HCI are very important parts of the Ne
tApp better together portfolio, particularly helping us help customers build cloud-like capabilities on-prem and deliver new services, but the same experience that they expect in cloud. NetApp, we have differentiated enterprise-class solutions in all 3 of
 these imperatives. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 And to talk to you about what we're doing on cloud, I'd like to invite Anthony Lye. \line }{

Good morning. I've been with NetApp now for more than a year, and the execution in my or
ganization has been phenomenal. I joined NetApp to write software. I joined NetApp to grow a large team of application developers and infrastructure developers to write software directly on the industry's leading and largest public clouds. \line }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So to compl
ete the 3 imperatives, it's my responsibility to give us an industry-leading and unique perspective for our customers and prospective customers as to how they embrace and inspire innovation on the public cloud. My responsibility is to provide us and our c
u
stomers with a winning strategy that's both best-in-class, but better together. As all of the previous speakers mentioned, and I would concur, that customers are operating against all of these 3 imperatives simultaneously. We are, however, of great intere
st to new companies, new application developers, new industries that were borne on the public clouds. We've established very unique and very compelling relationships with the industry's leading public clouds. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So what are we doing? You can think of us i
n the cloud data services organization as a group of software engineers building a set of consumable services, services that customers can consume like any other cloud service. Customers can consume those services as they go. They can pay us on a per-mont
h basis. They can equally subscribe to our services and sign long-term, single-year or multiyear agreements that can now exceed 6-, 7- and, we hope, 8-figure opportunities. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Our strategy is simple. We want to enable our customers to deliver all of their
 business outcomes for all of their IT workloads on a single cloud, on multi-cloud or on hybrid cloud environments. To do that, we engineer continuously a set of services that, we believe, have industry-leading performance and industry-leading total cost 
o
f ownership. On top of the hyperscalers, integrated seamlessly with their compute services and with their modern artificial intelligence and machine learning services, we are an integral part of the stack. What's great about our business model is we conti
n
uously deliver new innovation to our customers. Every single day, as we create new technology in software, that software is released to our entire customer base. Our entire customer base moves forward with us every single day we innovate. Every single one
 of our customers presents an opportunity for us to sell more and every day of innovation creates distance between ourselves and our competitors. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 We have, for example, leveraged ONTAP, the industry's leading storage-based operating system in a cloud-ce
ntric deployment and upgrade mechanism. We benefit from every single one of the innovations that Joel's organization provides us in ONTAP. But we consume ONTAP every single 30 days. Every single 30 days, we take ONTAP from Joel's organization and we relea
s
e it to the public cloud. So we're providing innovation to our customers at a cadence unmatched by any of our traditional competitors in a public cloud hyperscaler environment. And of course, we have a very unique and compelling relationship with our cust
o
mers. And through the announcement that we made last year, this summer, our cloud data services will be included in every single Microsoft seller's opportunity. So every single enterprise license agreement that's done by Microsoft for Azure presents an op
portunity for us to land and to expand our cloud data services and for our sellers to tell a hybrid cloud and multi-cloud Data Fabric-enabled strategy. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 The Data Fabric is an integral part of our thinking. Not only do myself, Brad and Joel, strive to be
 best-in-class, but we understand and include the Data Fabric in every element of our development. It's a very unique and very compelling story that we're able to tell to our customers, that we are the only organization that can provide a seamless data ma
nagement strategy to our customer base against the 3 big IT imperatives. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So what are we building? We're building technology above the storage layer. We're building solutions that help our customers manage their data. It starts with a set of data servic
es, services that operate on storage, storage that exists in the cloud, but, equally, storage that may exist on premise and, increasingly, data that's stored inside the SaaS-based applications. Those services include things like backing them up, making th
em ready for disaster recovery, protecting them and securing them. This is an ever-growing set of services that we monetize on our storage and on cloud storage. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 The next layer then is how we take those data services and the relationship that those data
 services have to the underlying data and how we bind those services, integrate those services, manage those services in the context of the application, in the context of the initiative, in the context of the business policy. So we have, at that layer, a 
r
ich orchestration engine that allows us and allows our customers to purpose these services for the new cloud buyers. Cloud architects, application developers and data scientists can now use our services directly within their day-to-day development, their 
day-to-day analytics and day-to-day cloud architectural strategies. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
On top of that then, we have leveraged our investment in OCI, our OnCommand Insight software platform, a platform today used extensively by our customer base in on-premise and across t
o the public cloud. Customers can use our technology to both monitor and optimize their data and their workloads across the hybrid cloud environments. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So what does that mean? What that really means is we have solutions that sit on top of the storage a
nd data layer, solutions that we can sell to on-premise customers as they operate within a hybrid cloud, but industry-leading solutions that we can sell on top of the public cloud services. We provide incremental value. We are complementary to the public 
clouds. As well as providing data management infrastructure on the storage and data itself, we increasingly provide those same services on the data sets that are being created and managed within the SaaS applications. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 ONTAP drives the heart of our busi
ness. ONTAP is a technology, a software solution that is the envy of every single public cloud. It provides the industry's leading performance. It provides the industry's leading services that we are able now to project and publish on these hyperscalers. 
A
nd this is something that isn't easy for us or anybody else to do. It's something that we started 5 years ago. More than 5 years ago, we made a decision to separate ONTAP from the engineered systems and to port ONTAP to the public clouds. And that's given
 
us a very, very compelling and very unique perspective and opportunity that nobody else can provide. We are releasing continuously more and more controls, more and more management systems and frameworks to orchestrate those services and to bind those serv
i
ces to the public cloud compute, artificial intelligence and machine learning-based capabilities. And then later this year, we'll be releasing a true cloud-based version of OnCommand Insight, a cloud-native performance management, performance monitoring a
nalytical tool to help our customers manage their workloads to optimize those workloads in a hybrid cloud world. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So this is a very comprehensive strategy and a very comprehensive and competitive piece of technology. You can buy this technology from us 
in its entirety or you can buy these services from us at any layer in the infrastructure. You don't have to start at the bottom. We can land our technologies at the top. We can land our technologies in the middle. And we can land our technologies at the b
ottom. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
We've made it very easy for these buying customers to do business with NetApp. You can access all of our services today through NetApp Cloud Central. Equally, all of our services are being published directly within the hyperscaler marketplaces. 
You can very simply, as a cloud architect, come to ourselves or to AWS and tell us or describe your challenge. Once you've described your challenge to us, we then provide a set of services for you to trial and then consume on the public clouds. So once yo
u
 select your service, we then provide you with our controls, with our orchestration platform, a platform that's available to you for AWS, a platform that will allow you to provision high-performing NFS and CIFS-based storage services to complement the pub
lic clouds in as little as 8 seconds. These services then start immediately billing on a predefined annual subscription or on a month-to-month basis. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 As well as getting our technology for AWS, I hope many of you recall our significant announcement we m
ade with Microsoft. At Insight last year in Las Vegas, Microsoft announced that they had selected our infrastructure to be the basis of Azure to complement Microsoft in the areas of NFS and CIFS and to give Microsoft and its customers access to our full s
tack of services. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Azure NetApp files is a Microsoft product. It is a product that we build for them and we run for them. It is a service that pays on a traditional subscription- and consumption-based business model. It's a business that's being rolled 
out around the world, and Microsoft will be selling this product. It will be included in every single Microsoft Enterprise license agreement. And so far, the uptake in our preview phase has been far beyond our expectations. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 What's most interesting abo
ut the uptake in our preview stage has been the number of non-NetApp customers who have come to Microsoft to procure this service. Of the multiple hundreds of customers that have been involved in previews, more than 70% of them are not considered NetApp s
trategic customers. Microsoft is bringing us opportunity to differentiate both themselves and to enable NetApp to provide its rich and unique services to Microsoft customers. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line 
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So what are these volumes? What makes them so interesting to the hyperscalers
? Well, they're incredibly fast, much, much faster and more complete than any other service delivered today on the public clouds, by the public cloud, in some instances, but by third-party software companies in other instances. Cloud volumes provide our c
u
stomers and, potentially, new customers with a whole bunch of new and unique value. The performance is amazing. We're benchmarking our cloud volumes in partnership with AWS to complement AWS services at more than 20x an equivalent Amazon service. So all o
f
 the rich, high-performing capabilities of ONTAP that were only, prior to this, available on our engineered systems are now available as first-class services on the public hyperscalers. And it's more than just the protocols. It's data protection without a
n
y application performance impact. It's replication and high availability on the public clouds operating just as we've been operating in our customers' enterprise data centers. Our cloud volumes today are available through Microsoft in the Azure console as
 
Microsoft -- as a Microsoft product and available through NetApp today in the AWS Marketplace. And while I'm not making any announcements, our services are of significant interest to all of the public hyperscalers. We provide things that they currently do
 not do. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
It's easy to do business with us. Our pricing is transparent and simple. You can buy our volumes at a set number of different performance tiers with very simple cloud-like pricing. Our relationships with the hyperscalers allow our customers to
 be billed for all of our services directly on the hyperscaler billing platforms directly. Cloud volumes on Azure will show up as an Azure service on the Azure bill. Cloud volumes for AWS will show up on your AWS bill as a NetApp line item. Our cloud cont
r
ols, our framework for orchestration and compute integration today are available on Azure and AWS. And we expect to announce more relationships with the other public hyperscalers. Our new multi-tenant cloud-based software product, cloud insights, will be 
announced later this year and will be going into a preview phase with customers prior to our formal general availability announcement this summer. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So what's wonderful about our strategy is the customers love it. And what's also important, I think, for 
you to understand is the hyperscalers love it. So we are not at odds with the hyperscalers, absolutely the opposite. We are integral to their development. We develop alongside them. We code directly into their infrastructure. And we are an integral part o
f
 their overall global strategy. We complement them with protocols and capabilities that are unavailable today on the public clouds. We bring extreme performance and industry-leading TCO to liberate and extend the opportunity for customers of NetApp and no
ncustomers of NetApp to prioritize their workloads now in ways they were unable to do before us. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
We unite. Over 25 years, NetApp has consistently extended its capabilities up into the application layer. And Joel highlighted a number of enterprise appli
cations that rely exclusively on our infrastructure that run faster on our infrastructure. All of that on-premise capability, combined with new cloud software companies, are all able to leverage our capabilities in ways that they were unable to do without
 ONTAP and NetApp. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
We're unique in that we support consistency across a single cloud, across multi-cloud and across hybrid cloud. The NetApp Data Fabric gives us and our customers a unique and highly performant platform to operate consistently at eithe
r extreme performance or industry-leading TCO in these mixed complex environments. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
And with our cloud insights, we provide our customers with analytics and insights to help them better manage their systems and cost their systems, whether again those systems are running in public cloud or on-premise. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
We think, and we're being told, that this is a very unique position. We love the public clouds. The public clouds love NetApp. It's a position that, we believe, we've created over many years and many, 
many man years of research and development and close engineering with the public clouds. It's a position that, I think, is unique to us and one that will serve us incredibly well over the years ahead. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 For a small, but fast-growing cloud business, we'r
e already powering a significant customer base and managing an enormous amount of our customers' data. Whether that data is on-prem or increasingly in the public cloud, we, in cloud data services, provide a platform unmatched by any company on the industr
y. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
It's not just in the smaller organizations who may have been the first adopters of cloud, but, increasingly, we are powering the data management infrastructures of the industry's largest companies. Six of the top 10 retailers rely on our data servic
es, 8 of the top 10 banks and 8 of the top 10 tech companies. These are existing NetApp customers and, increasingly, net new NetApp customers. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So when you look at the opportunity, we believe we are positioned to grow incredibly quickly within this opp
ortunity. We believe that we have a platform and relationships that are unmatched. And we believe that this opportunity, growing at a significant compound annual growth rate, is an industry that we can lead and an industry that we can -- we have plenty of
 room to grow within. It's an industry that, we think, is important for you to understand. It's an industry that, we think, will be meaningful to our customers and meaningful to our shareholders. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Now Ron's going to take you through a whole bunch of the
 logic and the detail behind this math. But we wanted to give you a sense, a sense of how big this business will be. So this business, as I've said, is a software business. This business is a recurring revenue software business, a recurring revenue busine
s
s that's made up of monthly consumption, annual and multiyear subscription and a business that, we believe, exiting FY '21 for us is significant. We believe that we have plenty of opportunity to grow this business, to end FY '21 somewhere between $400 mil
lion and $600 million in annual recurring revenues based on a software business model. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So we have, and I hope through myself, Brad and Joel, outlined for you not only our understanding of the 3 business imperatives, but our strategy of winning in each 
imperative and the uniqueness of the Data Fabric and how we can combine together to land new opportunities and then within those opportunities to expand. So thank you very much. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line

\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So I'm particularly happy with the success that we had in F
Y '18 because the results were not driven by one or 2 exceptional events, but rather by a success across the board. I'm encouraged by the progress that we've made and I'm very proud of how my team has executed our plans. And yet, as I'm going to talk to y
ou about today, we still have massive opportunities for improvement and I'm very excited about the journey ahead for us. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 What we've done in FY '18 is we've built confidence in the field that we can continue to lean forward and transform NetApp. So you'
ve seen this slide. The company is focused on creating sustained and profitable growth and has defined a very clear blueprint for that transformation. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 As a field leader, this blueprint translates for me in a very clear set of activities. First, as you
've seen, sell a multi-product portfolio aligned on the customer IT imperatives. Second, enforce a disciplined execution on our go-to-market transformation. And third, attract high-performing individuals that want to empower our customers to change the wo
rld with data. And I have to tell you that NetApp is now an extremely desirable destination for professionals in this industry that want to make a change. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 For FY '19, I have selected these 6 primary initiatives as the main vectors of performance improv
ement. First, with our absolutely unparalleled cloud portfolio, soon to be GA, we are putting in place specific teams to support our hyperscalers' relationships. Second, having launched our HCI product last quarter, we've set up dedicated teams to penetra
te rapidly that important market segment and we'll continue to develop that capability aggressively. Third, while our flash success is undeniable, we will not rest until we seize the #1 position in that market with a particular focus on SAN workloads. 
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Many of you have reported our momentum in the channel. It's well documented and we intend to further leverage our partners to extend our reach in the commercial market segment. We also continue to invest in the competency and expertise of our teams in thi
s world of data management, way beyond storage, in stark contrast with our generalist competitors. And of course, we will continue to improve our efficiency and drive this organization to be best-in-class when it comes to cost of sales. \line }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So in summary, 
this is a continuation of a journey that we started last year. We're going to be more efficient, we're going to be more focused and we're going to become more relevant as data management experts. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 You've seen this slide many, many times. Our go-to-mark
et model is somewhat traditional, but we're continuing to refine it because we want to deliver more customer intimacy and further optimize our go-to-market for each of the unique opportunities that those segments present. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Let me cover them. First, we 
had great success in FY '18 in our global accounts. And so we're taking another step by creating a global region -- a global sales region with the objective to provide an even more bespoke service to our largest customers. This will allow us to have a dee
per integration of our sales motion with the large system integrators and partners that target that particular market segment. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 In the enterprise, we're dedicating more field resources for a deeper penetration of the account base, focused on the largest
 geographies in the world with a clear goal to be either #1 or #2 in market share. I consider that being #1 in Germany is no easy feat. And if we can do it in that very demanding market, we can do it everywhere. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 And last but not least in the commercia
l segment, the combination of a stronger inside sales organization, our channel territory sales and our partners and distributors is aimed at providing a more efficient path to market for our resellers with a unique opportunity to take advantage of the be
st franchise in the industry and a great cloud story. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Talking about the channel, it really participates for us deeply in all of our sales motion across the pyramid. This allows me to focus more of my sales efforts towards our global and enterprise mark
et segments while our distributors and partners cover the commercial segment. And we enforce a very clear hard deck to ensure that the business opportunity for our partners is predictable. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712 
 \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 To support that particular effort, we're going to increase sig
nificantly our Express Pack portfolio aimed at velocity transaction. We're going to leverage new demand generation campaign that you'll hear from Jean. We're simplifying our processes to be easy to do business with and we're launching a new partner portal
 so that our partners and -- can self-serve their needs. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
What's new this year and exciting for me is that the hyperscaler relationships provide us with an enhanced coverage model where we can integrate this new sales motion in our go-to-market strategy
. It's fantastic for me to have the large sales organization of our hyperscale partners becoming an event creation engine for my sales organization. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So within that pyramid and throughout all these market segments, we're going to also put more emphasis
 towards differentiation between 2 fundamentally important but different sales motion and we're going to do that by dedicating resources and programs for each side of the pyramid. On the one side, of course, we want to land more new customers to expand ou
r reach in the marketplace. On the expense side, we have a unique opportunity with the enlarged product portfolio to expand our footprint in existing customers. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 I believe that our opportunity to land new logos is stronger than ever. Why? First, our clo
ud-first story and our cloud partnerships are unique and resonate with customers. We have our new HCI offering, which allow us to start new conversation with customers that have that particular IT imperative in mind. Our momentum in flash, and in particul
a
r our SAN momentum, also allows us to land new accounts. And then, lastly, our Data Fabric story and the strategy around stitching all of the components together with our professional services really provides a great story for customers. So we're deployin
g a dedicated team of individuals with highly leveraged comp plans that will be focused at penetrating new accounts on a named account basis. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 But we equally have a great opportunity on the expense side of the pyramid. The expanding flash portfolio with
 the great products that Joel talked about. Our converged infrastructure with the success of FlexPod, the addition of NFLEX and the HCI opportunity where, frankly, good solid NetApp customers were longing for a solution from us. The hybrid cloud solution 
a
nd the integration in the Data Fabric with all the cloud service providers that customers are needing. And last, our determination to address forcefully the renewal opportunity. So clearly, there's a lot more to this new NetApp than what we've done in the
 past and we have opportunities to really both expand and land new customers like never before. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
A year ago, I was here on stage and, if you recall, I presented to you the FY '18 priorities. So I want to take a second to reflect on our progress. I promi
sed you market share gains and I think you would admit that they were absolutely consistent across geographies and segments. I told you that we were going to make significant stride in flash and our success was remarkable, achieving #1 market share in man
y
 countries around the world. I told you that the combination of bookings growth and OpEx discipline in my shop would lead to a measurable improvement in cost per order dollar and we did that. I had bet that we could grow in global accounts and gain releva
nce in the margin -- market makers in both existing and acquired accounts and we did that. And last but not least, we committed to you that we would grow while improving product gross margin and we did that. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So for FY '19, I'm not taking off the table 
all of these imperatives because we can continue. They're not a destination, they're a journey. And we can continue to improve in all of these, but I'm adding a few new ones. First, obviously, we want to take full advantage of the time-to-market leadershi
p
 and the unique value proposition that we've created with the Cloud Volume product. Second, we want to maximize the opportunity with our data center grade hyperconverged solutions. Third, we have opportunities to increase our market share in the commercia
l
 segment via simpler fully configured solution, more digital marketing-driven sales motion and a cloud discussion. I promise you that we're going to improve our performance on maintenance renewal with a clear focus on that topic. And finally, I see an opp
o
rtunity to up-level the materials, the tools, the training for both our sellers and our partner sellers, leveraging the unique value of the Data Fabric strategy. We are about a lot more than storage and we need our entire channel to be able to articulate 
the value proposition. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Like in FY '18 and without going into the details, I promise you that all of these initiatives are supported by evolution of our compensation plan to continue to reward the right behaviors around profitable growth. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So buildi
ng on FY '18, I sincerely believe that our field will deliver an even stronger performance in FY '19. Why? First, we are really changing the customer conversation, leveraging the opportunity of more strategic conversation because of the Data Fabric and ou
r
 cloud-first strategy. Second, because we're going to continue to further focus the field investments on the highest growth and profit market areas. Third, because I believe that we still have a lot of opportunity to create greater leverage of our channel
 to address the commercial segment. And last, because it's about concentrating all of our resources on selling new product, addressing new workload and touching new customers. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So just like I did last year, I think we're embarking FY '18 with momentum a
nd confidence, but I also want to convey a sense of humility. We've identified clearly our priorities. Our customers and partners are expressing confidence in our strategy and, frankly, satisfaction with our execution. The team is ready for the challenge 
ahead. They're excited and they're ready to take on the challenge. So just like last year, I would close in saying, in my mind, the best is yet to come. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 And now I'd like to introduce my essential partner in go-to-market, Jean English, who will give you an update on how she is providing great support to my field organization. Thank you. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0

ing to, one, be bold in our story and drive interest with new buyers and existing customers; how we were going to focus on customer needs and create meaningful experiences that acquire and drive revenue for business impact; and how we plan to drive more t
han a campaign. We were going to build confidence in our customers, our partners, analysts, sellers, shareholders and employees. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Today, I'm going to talk about and show our incredible momentum and, number one, how NetApp is the leader in hybrid cloud t
o help customers accelerate their data-driven digital transformation; number two, that marketing's priorities and investments are going to lead this disruption; and number three, how we're going to continue to be laser-focused and bold in reinventing NetA
pp and aligning go-to-market to acquire new customers. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
In a world where, really, technology is changing the everyday lives, digital transformation still tops the agenda for most CEOs and leaders are under tremendous pressure to harness the value and th
e wealth of that data and apply it to create business value, and that's across the entire organization with limited budget, skills and time. And NetApp's unique approach to managing data holistically enables organizations to inspire innovation with the cl
oud, to build clouds to accelerate new services and to modernize IT architecture with cloud-connected flash. And we're clear on what our customers' needs are and we deliver the right solutions to accelerate their data-driven digital transformation. \line 
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 We 
know that data is becoming an increasingly important IT business driver as our industry evolves and the criticality and the centrality of data is the one constant in our industry right now. And for most companies, data used to be an enabler of business pe
rformance, but now data is the business and vendors that help customers manage and safeguard data will lead the next era of IT. And NetApp is that key partner. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So we asked ourselves, what do these companies who were leading the way in digital transform
ations, what do they have in common? And we concluded with a third-party study and looked at data thrivers. And with over 800 new buyers and decision-makers across industries around the world, and what did we discover? We found that the majority of organi
z
ations have no formal digital transformation processes. An organization's data-driven maturity is still emerging and only 11% are data thrivers, while 34% are data survivors. And the largest group, data survivors, are still identifying their digital trans
formation and they're project-based and their execution is ad hoc and IT and the business aren't always aligned. And data thrivers are companies that get it. They create disruption. They have constant input on data and they have a closed loop process. 
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
And we really see the data thrivers have 6 key attributes that help them excel in their digital transformations and drive bottom-line results. It all starts at the top. And data is considered an asset and data quality is priority #1. And the IT and the bu
s
iness, they work together. And data maps are created to give visibility and control of data and is disseminated equally and uniformly across the org and that insight spans systems including development. And as George mentioned, data thrivers see great res
ults and they are using data as a disruptor. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
NetApp is in the unique position to empower our customers to accelerate their data-driven digital transformation through the Data Fabric. And we know that people who win and lead are investing in utilizing t
he public cloud for innovation with AI and analytics. They are seeking DevOps skills to build apps at speed. They're modernizing their infrastructure to free resources and provide efficiency to fund transformation with intelligence. And they're hiring new
 roles such as Chief Data Officers to thrive with data. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
And really, the NetApp Data Fabric simplifies and integrates data management services and applications across clouds, public cloud, private cloud, multi-cloud, on-premises, to accelerate their dat
a-driven digital transformation. And our focus on these 3 IT imperatives is really to inspire, really, innovation in the cloud to innovate, to integrate, to protect, to optimize on all the biggest clouds. They're going to build clouds to accelerate new se
rvices that simplify, automate and scale next-generation cloud architecture. And they're going to modernize IT architecture with cloud-connected flash to see the performance, the intelligence, the protection for a hybrid cloud world. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1

portunity to help every company who is not thriving today to reach that potential. And this is why our message resonates so well. And this is why NetApp is the key partner for companies who are succeeding in their digital transformation and becoming stron
ger businesses. NetApp delivers the Data Fabric built for the data-driven world. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Marketing is very clear on our direction. We've created significant momentum in FY '18 and we're going to keep the goals consistent and continue to measure and deliver aga
inst them in FY '19. We're going to continue to tell the story of the new NetApp, to build market relevancy by focusing on cloud first. We're going to create a buyer-centric focus around their needs to reach new buyers. We're going to deliver meaningful e
xperiences at every single touch point that's increasingly digital to acquire new customers. And we're going to build and excel as a world-class modern marketing organization and optimize demand. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

ition NetApp as the data authority in hybrid cloud. Let's talk about some of the events and results we've seen so far and we are building upon. We did this in a bold way. We re-branded NetApp and set the tone for a discussion around data and digital trans
formation and the important role that we play as the data authority in hybrid cloud. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
We reinvented our largest conference, Insight, evolving from a technical conference to a buyers' experience and energized our community of customers, partners and empl
oyees to change the world with data. We saw our largest attendance ever. There were 9,000 people and had an additional 5,000 join us over live stream. And for value delivered, Insight had a record-breaking attendee satisfaction and we're excited for our I
nsight this fall in Vegas and Barcelona. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
To engage employees, we celebrated the milestone of our 25th anniversary, recognizing the heritage of NetApp while looking forward to the future. And we added to the strength of the NetApp voice and we can reall
y be known for strong point of view and thought leadership on data like our data thriver report. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
We're driving a data-driven digital transformation that has numbered the double of visits to our website, of which 85% are brand new and had never even ta
lked to us before. And we're also opening up our new data visionary center in May, which will attract new buyers. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
And with this reinvention, we're repositioning NetApp. 70% of potential buyers from our studies now view NetApp as the data authority in 
hybrid cloud. Our story is resonating with industry analysts and they are saying, "NetApp's back, baby, flaunting the new tech and Azure cloud swagger." And IDC says, "A refreshing change to see NetApp become bold in connecting to new buyers such as CIOs 
a
nd cloud and enterprise architects." The industry analyst sentiment is strong to extremely strong across flash, what we're doing at HCI and converged infrastructure as well as cloud. We are in a great position to build upon this reinvention of NetApp. And
 with this change, becomes opportunity and we're seizing it every day. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
We're winning new buyers because we're targeting new buyers with solutions that approach their needs. And we're driving more strategic partnerships with these new buyer types. We se
e these new buyers such as data innovation leaders, evolutionary agents, revolutionary agents and innovation influencers. With our software and cloud focus, we get into the hearts and minds of new levels of IT leadership. And by understanding their behavi
ors and what they care about, we target their needs. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
We are driving more strategic partnerships with data innovation leaders. And for example, David from Children's Mercy Hospital, he cares about digital transformation and he's focused on learning more
 analytics and AI in the cloud. We held our inaugural executive summit last year at Insight, our largest global conference, and we invited CIOs and Chief Data Officers to attend. We wanted to learn more about these new buyers and for them to learn more ab
o
ut the new NetApp. We're also gaining more mind share with evolutionary agents. And Duleep from Solis Mammography, he cares about accelerating workloads and connecting to the cloud. And we're gaining continued momentum and disrupting competitors with new

orkloads every day as you have heard from Joel. We're also attracting revolutionary agents. And we take Steven from Ultimate Software, and what's most important to him is scalability and growing with change and making sure he's driving apps at speed. And 
N
etApp is bringing enterprise-grade scalability solutions to simplify and automate workloads. We are acquiring innovation leaders like Lorenzo from EidosMedia and his first priority is innovating in the cloud. And as you heard from Anthony, we now have ove
r 1,800 customers utilizing cloud data services in the public cloud today. We're acquiring and partnering with these new buyers every day to accelerate their data-driven digital transformations. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

 as we go through channels and as we look at new workloads. And we do this with a focused approach. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712

 on the needs of our new and existing customers. We've identified who is surviving and who is thriving in a data-driven digital transformation and to accelerate their pace. We're uniquely positioned to win new buyers with Data Fabric. Marketing is closely

\line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Good morning. Happy to see you all here today. 
So I look forward to connecting what you've just heard from George, Joel, Brad, Anthony, as well as Henri and Jean, with a view toward sustained and profitable growth for NetApp. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So I'm going to cover the following topics: First, we'll look back at FY
 '18, which is almost over. Secondly, as we look prospectively, I'll give you a view on our implementation of 606, which, as most of you know, we're moving from 605 Rev Act to 606. I'll give a specific guide for FY '19 and I'll give you a new 3-year guide
 for FY '19 through '21, which is a long-term model, think of that as our long-term model. And then finally, I'll give you an update on our capital allocation plans. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So let's start with a look back at FY '19. We are really proud of the progress we've m
ade thus far in FY '18 -- I'm sorry, look back at FY '18. We are really proud of the progress we've made thus far at FY '18. As I said on our Q3 call, our Q3 results speak to our successful pivot to the growth areas of the market supported by our industry
-leading innovation and execution. We are well positioned to deliver on our commitments and expect continued progress in Q4. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So let's look at revenue for FY '18. So let me explain the chart here real quick. On the left-hand side, it says FY '18 guide. 
This provides what we guided on our Q4 '17 earnings call. I didn't guide FY '18 at this meeting last year. The middle column is the FY '18 implied performance, which shows the first 3 quarters of FY '18 actuals and the midpoint of our Q4 guide, which I'm 
n
ot updating today. And the far right column shows highlights related to our FY '18 implied performance. So as you can see highlighted in blue, revenue for FY '18 is better than we had planned. It's being led by double-digit year-over-year product revenue 
growth. We exceeded revenue expectations driven by a strong flash performance and stabilizing mature revenue. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Moving to gross margin. We improved gross margin and specifically product margin, which grew year-over-year by 3 points, by rationalizing prom
otions and driving an increase in sales discipline. This is good progress, but we clearly have more opportunity here. To Henri's point, this demonstrates our ability to grow both revenue and gross margin. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Moving down to op margin. Op margin for FY '18
 was spot-on to what we had planned, right at the midpoint, and we're really pleased with this improvement. It's a 2-point improvement year-over-year. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Moving down to EPS. Thanks to the outperformance in revenue and our strong gross margin performance 
and continued OpEx prudence, EPS was considerably better than our guide and it demonstrates the enormous leverage in our business model. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 And finally, free cash flow. And for this -- for free cash flow, I didn't guide Q4. So this is really the first 3 
quarters of FY '18 actuals. And as you can see, it was much higher than what we had planned due to a 26-day improvement in the cash conversion cycle. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 All in all for FY '18, we are continuing to improve the trajectory of the company. Not only did we do
 what we'd said we do in FY '18, we did better than what we said we'd do. Better on revenue, better on gross margin, consistent on op margin, better on EPS and better on free cash flow. I'm very proud of our progress and momentum thus far in FY '18. 
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 A
s you know, we've been consistently meeting or beating guidance each quarter in FY '18. So what can you take away from FY '18? We're growing faster than we had planned. More importantly, last year, we told you there were many reasons why we could and shou
l
d grow faster than low single digits. And we did, EPS growth was well over 20% year-over-year, but we've delivered on consistent execution even going back to FY '17. This represents a great deal of hard work and it's not an accident. Part of transformatio
n is a key focus on execution. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Okay. Now most of you know that we must transition in FY '19 from 605 to 606. I'll talk about some of the general changes and then specific things that relate to us at NetApp. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So here are some highlights. It was a ch
ange in the methodology of allocating revenue across product and maintenance. Professional services can be recognized as a percent of completion as opposed to at-contract completion. There's a onetime reset of prepaid commissions to align expense with rev
enue recognition on deferred maintenance and a onetime reset of deferred revenue to reflect lower allocation of value to maintenance, which results in a reduction of deferred revenue. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  
\line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So let's take a look how this applies to NetApp. So for us, this wil
l result slightly higher product revenue, but lower maintenance revenue. At the total revenue line, which is the only guide I give, it's immaterial to the P&L. Similarly, for gross margin, you might see slightly higher product margins, but lower services 
m
argin. Again, immaterial to the gross margin guide. And for OpEx, commissions will be expensed as revenues that are recognized. Again, immaterial to OpEx, so not surprisingly for op margin, but some of these changes are essentially immaterial. This was a 
lot of work, but in the end, it's not going to change the guides we're going to give you. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So your takeaway on 606. It's immaterial to guidance and we'll begin reporting under 606 in Q1 of FY '19. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So now moving on to specific FY '19 guidance. As we look ahead at FY '19, our momentum and our progress in transformation have changed our view of the future. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Now let's look at why, starting with revenue. The left-hand column is what I did give as a 3-year guide at last year's Analyst Day. It was '18,
 '19 and '21 (sic) [ '20 ] together as a continuum. The middle column is what we're guiding FY '19 today. So what we told you implied in the 3-year guide last year was revenue would grow low single digits. Today, for FY '19, what we're saying is FY '19 sh
ould grow mid-single digits. We are increasing the guide on revenue. The key drivers are flash, HCI and cloud data services. Cloud data services alone in FY '19 contributes about 1 point of growth. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Onto gross margin. Gross margin for FY '19 will be ess
entially flat at 63%. There's a slight headwind from some of the start-up costs from our SaaS business. But even with that headwind, we're consistent with our guidance from last year for FY '19. Baked in this guide is some increase in product margin as we
 continue to focus on this opportunity. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Moving to operating -- OpEx. So we're consistent with our guidance on OpEx. We're still committing to minimal OpEx growth in FY '19. We're able to fund investments to reach new buyers and drive innovation from additional productivity in the business. 
\line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Onto op margin. Here, you see a dramatic improvement in op margin. We are at the high end of our previous 3-year long-term model. This is an increase in our guidance, again due to better revenue, improving gross margin and continued OpEx prudence. \line }
{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Onto EPS. We are increasing our guide for EPS. We see over 15% growth in EPS year-to-year. This would make FY '19 the third consecutive year of double-digit year-over-year EPS growth. And within this, you should assume for FY '19 an 18% tax rate. \line }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Now onto free cash flow. We're increasing our estimate for free cash flow even while investing in CapEx for our SaaS business. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So let's look at FY '19 in aggregate. So what you see is that, again, in every key cate
gory for FY '19, we are increasing or maintaining expectations for FY '19 as compared to what we told you a year ago. This is, again, due to great execution and consistent delivery against our plans. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So for FY '19, your takeaways are we are building o
n positive momentum here with sustained mid-single-digit top line growth driven by strong growth in flash, HCI and cloud. And this will be the second consecutive year of over $1 billion in free cash flow generation. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So moving on. Now that you've seen 
a preview of FY '19, let's look at our full 3-year long-term model. So last year, I guided '19, '20 and '21 (sic) [ '18, '19, '20 ]. Obviously, this year, it will be '19, '20, and '21. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  
\line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Starting with revenue. So again, we are increasing our long-term t
op -- long-term model for top line growth. Mid-single-digit revenue growth is sustainable over the long term led by all-flash, HCI and a growing cloud data services business, which grows exponentially from 1% of revenue FY '19 to $400 million to $600 mill
i
on in FY '21. There may be a concern that cloud is cannibalizing our business, but in fact, we are seeing it to prove to be additive to our business. As Henri mentioned earlier, we expect services to no longer be a headwind in FY '19 as a result of improv
ement in renewals execution. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Moving on to gross margin. For gross margin, we are increasing our long-term model because of our SaaS business, because our SaaS business is accretive to gross margin. This gross margin guide assumes we will continue to dr
ive toward 55% product margin in the traditional business. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Onto OpEx. We continue to make important investment in growth areas that do not increase our OpEx and maintain a disciplined approach to reinvestments. We continue to fund these investments th
rough efficiencies. We continue to manage OpEx prudently, but won't shortchange investments. We are not only making investments in the cloud business, but we continue to make investments in each of our key product areas. We have a couple more years of hol
ding OpEx roughly flat and then some later investments may be slightly incremental in the out year. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Onto op margin. We've increased our long-term model for op margin from 18% to 22% to 20% to 24%. Operating margin leverage drives margins from the low 2
0s -- I'm sorry, operating leverage drives operating margins to low 20s with SaaS margins in the outer years driving overall business to the mid-20s. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Onto EPS. We're increasing our long-term model for EPS, growing EPS over 15% each year. And the tax rate will increase slightly from 18% in FY '19 to 20% in the out years FY '21. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Onto free cash flow. We're also increasing our long-term model in free cash flow from -- to 19% to 24%, that was from 16% to 22%. And this is clearly due to higher profitability and SaaS contribution. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So in aggregate, our 3-year model, we have increased our previous 3-year model across revenue, gross margin, op margin, EPS and free cash flow while maintaining discipline with OpEx. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  
\line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So your takeaways for our long-term
 model, we expect to continue to gain share in flash and HCI and we expect to grow exponentially with cloud. Cloud is both additive and accretive. It does not cannibalize our other businesses. SaaS will drive improvements in gross margin, op margin and fr
ee cash flow. All of this while continuing to fund our growth initiatives. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So let's move on to capital allocation. I'm very pleased with our plan to increase returns to shareholders. What I'll be announcing will be -- here in a moment will be exciting for all investors. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
So let's start with an update on dividends. Effective Q1 FY '19, we're announcing that we are doubling our dividend and we remain committed to increasing it over time. So we're increasing dividend from $0.80 per share per year to $1
.60 per share per year. Our goal is to ensure that the dividend continues to be a meaningful and regular return to shareholders. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 As for share repurchase, we completed the $2.5 billion previous share repurchase commitment. It's done. We've said before 
it will be done by May of this year. We're actually done now. And today, we're announcing a new $4 billion share repurchase, roughly 25% of our current market cap. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 As it relates to debt, last year, I told you we would, in the event of tax reform, we'd
 likely -- possibly potentially delever. We will do some slight delevering, although we do want debt as part of our capital structure. And we do want to maintain an investment grade rating 2 to 3 notches above investment grade. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 As for M&A, although we
 are constantly evaluating M&A targets, tax reform will not change our approach to mergers and acquisitions. We will maintain a disciplined approach. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So for capital allocation altogether, I am very pleased to be able to continue to deliver a robust ca
pital allocation strategy for our shareholders and we're consistent with what we told you about capital allocation at last year's Analyst Day. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So your takeaways here are doubling a dividend, new $4 billion repurchase. It continues a long history that NetApp has in returning significant cash to shareholders. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

So in summary, today, I've covered the success in FY '18. We've cleared up any concerns you might have about 606 as it's really immaterial. It's a lot of work, but immaterial. We took a look at
 FY '19 and how we can sustain revenue growth and increase profitability. I completed the picture with a new long-term model. And then, we enhanced our 3-year guide with a strong capital allocation plan. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

lowing 4 points. First, a reminder about our total available market. As George discussed, our TAM has expanded. This is the foundation for our sustained revenue growth. Secondly, we are excited about cloud. After listening to our cloud strategy presented 
e
arlier today, you should have heard several key messages. Our cloud strategy has great momentum with significant global partners. We have found cloud to be accretive -- I'm sorry, additive to our business, not cannibalistic. And cloud leads to an improvem
e
nt in our business model as it's accretive in the outer years. Third, our business model continues -- our business leverage continues. We continue to enjoy the leverage in our business model yielding considerable free cash flow and earnings growth. And fo
urth, we are committed to shareholder returns through significant buybacks and dividends. You should begin to feel the power of the new, bold NetApp. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 In total, I'm confident in and very pleased with both our leverage through margin improvement and our 
compelling cloud strategy as now shown in FY '19 and an improved 3-year long-term model for sustained and profitable growth. Thank you. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

I think Ron summarized my perspectives on acquisitions. We do not see that tax reform is an event that 
changes our perspective on acquisitions. We've always been a disciplined acquirer and every acquisition is looked at for both strategic fit and financial merit. We feel very good with the portfolio that we have today. We constantly look at the marketplace
, but we don't see major holes to the plans that we're executing. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
I think the fact that we have leveraged existing technology to move to the cloud gives us a unique benefit. No other competitor in the market is able to execute a seamless Data Fabric mo
del between public and private cloud. And so you'll continue to see us exploit the assets in our disposal in more creative ways while looking at acquisitions if needed, but we feel very good about where we are. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

Amit Daryanani, RBC Capital. I guess, 2 questions. First, Anthony, for you, when you talk about $500 million to $600 million revenu
e from cloud data services, just help me understand how much are you generating today from this business? And is this something that's a unique relationship that you will have with the hyperscale customers or can they partner with others as well? And how 
would that change the economics over time? \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712

ocation basis? And is that part of the 15% EPS growth? \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Anthony  Lye}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 I'll start. On the revenue side, I'll defer that to Ron. But in terms of the strategy, we are, I think, in a very unique position, but not an

o
 a great start and we foresee a lot more opportunity for us in our partnership. We are actively developing with the public hyperscalers a set of new services that we will incrementally roll out to our customer base on a continuous basis. We'll continue to
 sort of increase our value not just at the base level within the sort of high-performing protocols, but you can expect to see continued innovation in our data services, in our Cloud Controls and in our insights and analytics. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0

Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley. The cloud strategy and messaging today is incredibly clear, but the other trend or theme that came out through the presentation is this idea of AI machine learning. But I'm not sure I understand w

which is around OpEx. Last year, you said minimal OpEx. You have a little bit of growth in fiscal '18, but you were convicted it would be flat after that. You're now talking about disciplined growth. Is that a function of new opportunities that arose over
 the last year? Is that a function of tax reform and the economy and you just -- you feel better about the business? Just understanding the philosophy behind that. Thanks. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{

So in relation to our artificial intelligence and machine learning, I guess, the best example I can talk about is something that we've implemented within NetApp in the last couple of years, which is a revision of our -- sort of our legacy t
elemetry tool into something called Active IQ where we are now using 25 years of data that we've had around the organization and billions of data points that we get in every month and we've been able to really transform the way we communicate and support 
c
ustomers. It involves building a very large data lake. It involves building that data lake and using compute from the public cloud in order to deal with the scale of that data lake. And the end result of all of that is that we've reduced the times -- we'v
e
 reduced the time and cost of serving our customers. We're delivering information to them real-time. That helps them optimize their infrastructure. And what we've done is we've taken that reference design, really something that's operating within NetApp t
hat's a hybrid cloud data lake design, and we are deploying that within customers across industries and across verticals now so that they can do the same thing with data. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So it requires -- so storage should be effective in artificial intelligence and m
achine learning. It has to be across the hybrid cloud. Some of it makes sense to be on-premise, but some of the tools, especially that you get in the hyperscalers like HDInsight or other analytic tools, you could only get in a public cloud. So for us, it'
s a really good example of the combination of having a really strong on-premise high-performance flash story, but a very strong connection to the tools in the public cloud. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{

t I would add to that is the unique propositions that we have for both cloud and for something like machine learning or artificial intelligence is that the power of the cloud and the power of some of the new machine learning GPUs is that you are able to a
ssemble an enormous amount of compute at a very cost-effective price point. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
Now what's not existing in the cloud today and what doesn't exist today for the most part in machine learning is high-performance storage that can deliver the value that's aggregating all of that compute environment creates, right? \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 
And so I would say, at a high level, the ideas are very similar. Today, if you look at machine learning environments, they either are on -- the vast majority of them will run on NFS, high-perform
ance NFS. There are some sort of super high-end commercial HPC environments that run on proprietary file systems like Lustre. But we feel really good about our position in the market, again, taking advantage of the work that we've done in flash. \line }{

Yes, I would just add, the best thing about machine learning is the term Big Data. And we like big and we like data. And as you all probably know, data doesn't like to be moved. It's pretty heavy and sticky
. And so there's this thirst from the customer to take advantage of this unlimited compute. The challenge is how do I get my data to it? How do I manage it once it's there? If I'm enriching it with machine learning, how do I get it back? So it's that data
 
fabric and the services that we provide seamlessly to our customers. Whether data is coming from on-premise, whether data is coming from the outside world, it has to get to the compute, be managed properly when it's there and returned when it's enriched.

With respect to OpEx, so it might sound like I'm saying something different, but remember, last year's guide was '18, '19 and '20
. Now I'm guiding '19, '20 and '21. So I said last year, there's 3 years we could probably hold off, that's the -- and we're actually doing that. But that outyear, '21, we probably have some slight need for incremental investment because it will have gott
en to the benchmarks reached -- function in the company. But again, the desire would be to keep that OpEx's increase obviously lower than revenue. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0

Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo. A question on the competitive landscape. One of the things that's been extremely successful for NetApp is going into the all-flash market and the momen
tum that you've seen. Can you talk a little bit about how you frame the growth expectations for your all-flash business as you look into fiscal 2019? And obviously, I think, one of the questions that we get a lot of is EMC competitively, what's happened t
h
ere, what are you seeing as they kind of throw out the strategy of refuse to lose. And on the same flash topic, I'd be curious of where you stand on kind of internal architecture around NVMe. You talked a little bit about NVMe over Fabrics. But curious at
 where you stand, how that's important in the all-flash side as well? \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Joel D. Reich}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0

we see that NVMe started out as just another way of connecting media to a system, right? And that's sort of where -- it's sort of where it's been used. We've been shipping it in our systems as a flash cache for about 1.5 years, right? And it's effective i
n
 that way. But we see a much greater potential with it as a way of disaggregating storage from the controller as a way of building really capable high-performance systems. And that's something we've all -- we actually already shipped our first product in 
t
he E-Series product in the fall, and we'll be making some announcements later this year around building out the rest of that strategy. So we think it's a great match to deal with the artificial intelligence machine learning workloads that require that opt

mal performance and think that it's going to be a key technology in the future. It also will allow us to tie in, as I talked about in my presentation, as more flash variants appear in the ecosystem, especially in the server level, it's also going to allow
 
us to take advantage of those things and build them into a broader flash ecosystem vision that we have. So it's early now. It's just an interface in the system, but as the technology matures, we're taking a leadership position in that. We see that it'll a
dd benefit to the portfolio over time. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Henri P. Richard}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

Yes. So in terms of the layers, they are sort of logical. What we try to do in our description of those layers is present a holistic solution in that we are --
 we think we are unique in that we can provide value that integrates very nicely at all of the layers. But our customers can purchase services from us at any layer. So any one of the layers we can present unique value to our customers irrespective of whet
h
er we own the other layers. And so you can think of the model as being a combination of those services. The mix, we're not really sharing because customers are purchasing from us based on their short-term needs and then how we expand within the organizati
o
ns. It's largely based on their strategic imperatives and the weighting of any one of the 3. Some will move faster to embrace public clouds. Others will continue to improve their on-premise performance with flash. So think of the services as like a cookbo
o
k. It's a set of incremental services that customers can buy at very, very low price points to get started all the way up to very significant multi-year subscription-based deals. In terms of the competitive landscape, we find ourselves in a wonderful posi
t
ion where there are well-defined opportunities for us on the hyperscaler platforms that are not fulfilled by the hyperscalers. And for those opportunities, we are being sought out. And we see interest in the space from a number of smaller startup companie
s
 who only really provide parts of our solution, even parts of a solution just within my business unit while they don't have -- which I hope is coming through is that the combination of the 3 is what really gives us leverage. It's actually I don't have to 
b
uild ONTAP. I have a ton of people in Joel's organization who do that for me. And so I am just a benefactor of all of the great services that are built and execute so incredibly well on-premise, that the decision, really, the fundamental thing I learned w
h
en I was looking at this opportunity was NetApp decided more than 5 years ago to put an investment in to taking ONTAP from an engineered system to a public cloud. And I can assure you, that is not an easy thing to do. But now you've done it. It gives us a
n
 enormous, I think, barrier to entry and an opportunity for us to move very, very quickly. I'm taking, as I said to you, guys, I'm taking ONTAP every 30 days. Any new innovations that are in ONTAP, I get them every 30 days, and I release those to my custo
mers in the cloud. So it's the combination of the sheer amount of work it took to move and the CI/CD process and the ultimate release processes that enable us to move very, very quickly. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712

It's Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International. Two questions, first one for George. Can you help us understand how your customers are thinking about IT investment? It seems to me that the -- your enterprise customer base have been going through an
 upgrade cycle that started spring of 2017. And I want to get your views of how sustainable is that. Is it a multi-year cycle or just a multi-quarter? And the second question has to do with cloud strategy. Thanks for all the details, and it seems to me th
a
t this strategy is like a cloud 1.0 focused on hybrid and especially for enterprise customers that are moving the workload from on-prem to a public cloud. What happens to customers that new -- up and coming enterprises that are putting all their workload 
o
n a cloud? Some may refer to it as AI and deep learning, machine learning. But at the end of the day, these are the new enterprises that soon to be Uberization of the economy that is going to be focused on leveraging the public cloud for 100% of their IT 
infrastructure. And I want to hear how you're thinking about taking NetApp Cloud 1.0 to Cloud 2.0, if there is such a thing. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

ith our customers, I think there is more clarity on the economic outlook. I think consistent global growth is helping people be more confident about the outlook. And secondly, there's, perhaps, more clarity on what they're going to do on the cloud and, th
e
refore, what they ought to do on-premises. That is creating more confidence in IT spending. I'm not going to forecast how long that lasts. What I will tell you is we plan our business on the fact that IT spending is susceptible to the economic outlook. We
 
do not believe that if the economic outlook dims, that IT spending somehow is in a special place. So that is part of the reason why we have been focused on productivity in our business model. With regard to the cloud, I think what Anthony talked about was
 
that we address a broad range of customer use cases. Cloud 1.0, we have several customers that we have never met on-premises. In fact, if you look at the majority of the customers who we are talking to with Azure Files, they are customers that we have nev
e
r interacted with, and they are not in the lift-and-shift workload business. They are in the net new workload business. To be honest, the majority of the cloud deployments that we see are actually net new workloads. We don't see any IT department. Certain
ly, I am not giving my CIO a check to "lift and shift" applications to the cloud. They are going to deploy new workloads that drive the business imperatives on the cloud. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{

ry current with the data lake AI and ML strategies. And as Joel mentioned, we have a tremendous offering for people investing in data lakes. Data lakes, almost by default, because of the AI and ML capabilities, most organizations are building those native
l
y in the cloud. Underneath those data lakes, we have the highest-performing protocols at the best TCOs. And we basically drive a significant number of data lake strategies. Regardless of whether those data lake strategies were born on-premise and integrat
e
d to the cloud or were just solely born on cloud. The other thing I would tell you is we are very current with containers and other new application development technologies and techniques that allow the new applications, the new SaaS applications that, ag
a
in, are born on the cloud to use our capabilities, capabilities that are not available to them on the public clouds, either through the hyperscalers or through smaller niche start-ups. So we're very relevant, obviously, in lift and shift. And lift and shi
f
t isn't binary. If you think about something like DevOps, a piece of the process may move to the cloud we're great. We're very, very relevant to Cloud 2, which I think is the SaaS application born in the cloud, container, server-less application architect
ures and very relevant to Phase 3, the big data lake AI, ML processes. We have intellectual property and services that are as relevant to all -- any one of the 3 as any other. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line

Yes, I'd like to just add to it. I mean, I think also, a lot of those 2.0 companies that maybe they are younger, they're smaller companies that just natively start in the cloud have no initial on-prem expecta
tions. I think we're also going to see some of them as they grow over time and they have SaaS, as they have to worry about data sovereignty and locality. They're going to find some opportunities that they're going to have to move back. And I think, when w
e
 think about our data fabric and new data fabric opportunities, Anthony and I can envision. We want to be able to -- for those who started natively as 2.0, but as their business model requires them to have the same kind of capabilities on-prem, I think we

Ananda Baruah, Loop Capital. Two, if I could. The first is, George, just with regards to go-to-market, are there any natural share gain opportunities that maybe just haven't been present to you guys ove
r the last couple of years that now will be present just by virtue of really touching customers in more ways and touching customers in different ways that maybe you could have been doing in prior years but are now doing pretty effectively? That's the firs
t
 question. And then the second question is with regards to cloud data services. For the friction points that you guys are addressing seemingly quite effectively, how is it that prior to your solutions, customers have been addressing those friction points?
 Just trying to get a sense of the delta that exists between your solutions and what's going on today. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Okay. Maybe I can start. We see a lot of opportunities for share gains. There's a lot of weak players in
 the on-premises market. We see that as the cloud gets more and more relevant, we are uniquely positioned with world-class technology for the cloud. And as Anthony mentioned, one of the things that we've seen with the work that we've done with the hypersc
a
lers is that the majority of the new applications that we are serving are with people that we've never interacted with. And so it allows us to build a relationship with them. We get successful in a part of their business, and then it expands our relations
h
ip. Our competitors have no answer for the cloud. Our traditional legacy competitors simply stand up on stage and say, "We think you can do what you want to do on the cloud on-premises." And that is a backward-looking point of view. And so we feel very we
l
l positioned. I think if there is a place that we can do more, is to align our go-to-market resources so that we can go for the jugular, and that's what Henri is doing, right? We have got dedicated land teams now that are focused on going after the compet
ition. And so you'll see us amp up the pressure. With regard to the cloud and its existing uses, I'll let Anthony comment on that. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

e first and probably the biggest is nothing. They haven't been able to move workloads to the cloud because the protocol on the performance has not been there. So there is an untamed backlog of opportunity that the public clouds see and are partnering with
 
us. The second thing that they've done if they've had to go to the cloud is that they have to use what's available. More often than not, that means object-based storage. An object-based storage has some pros and some cons. The biggest challenge is if your
 
application, and many do, uses a file structure, converting a file structure into an object structure is possible. You just have to go through that horrible convert thing, and that convert thing usually means copy it and transform it. And data, as you all
 
know, doesn't really like to do that to itself. It likes to stay in its native format, and it expects compute to operate on it as it sits there. So we have seen some businesses move to the cloud by transforming or copying their data from one format to ano
t
her. We actually are seeing a number of those vendors, customers, call us and say, "Oh, my God. I can transform it back? And I can now use all of the pros of Object Storage combined with all of the pros of file-based storage." And selfishly, as an applica
t
ion developer, that's what you want. You want to be able to choose the right protocol and the right structure for your application. And the public clouds give you now a wealth of opportunity that you can use, consistently. You don't have to pick one or th
e other. So a lot of nothing, not been possible before based on performance and protocols, and a lot of transformation that we think we can complement as people move forward by offering both. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

,
 which will bring new applications on the cloud. So it's not like every idea that we bring to the cloud is substituted against something that's there. I think we're just expanding the overall set of capabilities that exist in the cloud. And so you'll see

-wide and an inch deep. And I think that has been the source of success, not only by innovating in certain specific markets and staying focused on those, but also to deliver productivity in the business model, right? I think we have an enormous well of in
t
ellectual property in software. I think that the fact that the hyperscalers, with all of their enormous R&D resources, are working so closely with us, says that we have something unique. And how we execute going forward is going to be to deliver innovatio

Thank you, Kris. Thank you to all of you again, those are on our webcast and those that are here in attendance. I wanted to ju
st summarize a few key themes that we shared with you. We talked about the industry and the market opportunity that major customer trends are foster for NetApp. The idea that every company is trying to transform its business using data and technology, and
 
those that are data-driven, meaning having their data management infrastructure, the tools and the organizational capabilities to be data thrivers, have a step function benefit, an advantage versus competitors who are not. We also shared that there was a 
s
ubstantial opportunity to enable all of the organizations in the world with those types of capable infrastructures. We talked about the fact that, the IT imperatives that support transformation played out to modernize IT infrastructures and standardize th
e
m to build clouds, environments that were similar to the hyperscalers and to leverage the innovation that existed on the hyperscalers. And we talked about the transformation of NetApp to execute against those opportunities. Hopefully, you met, at least th
rough the presentations, the leadership team that were clearly aligned with each of the strategic imperatives and in transforming our go-to-market and delivering a disciplined business model with a commitment to shareholder returns. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 So let me summarize
 with a few closing thoughts. We have and continue to drive the transformation of NetApp to expand sustained and profitable growth. The expansion of our total available market, TAM and share gains in the largest and growing segments of our existing market
 
supports sustained growth. We have industry-leading, software-intensive products and solutions aligned with the customer priorities. Uniquely in the industry, the data fabric unifies the portfolio and is winning on the biggest hyperscaler clouds and on-pr
e
mises. The cloud is a substantial opportunity that is additive and accretive to our business. And we have driven and continue to drive focused execution to deliver share gains across the portfolio. In addition, transformation delivers a strong business mo
del, leading to considerable free cash flow and earnings growth. And finally, you've seen our strong commitment to shareholder returns, as evidenced by significant buybacks and the dividends. \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

 the lunch and look forward to answering any more questions you have. So thank you for your attendance. Kris? \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs16\cf1\insrsid13258712  \line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712

\line  \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs20\cf1\insrsid13258712 Thanks, George. And thanks, everyone, who joined us on the webcast. We r
eally appreciate it. For those of you who are in the room, don't forget the surveys. Really want to hear your feedback. So we're going to invite you to stay for lunch with our executives. I'll give you a little overview of how that plan's going to go. So 
w
e have 4 lunchrooms here. There are 2 buffet stations outside. You'll go outside, grab your lunch, settle down in one of the 4 rooms. There are -- one just outside the doors to the left, 2 to the right and then one just right past where you came in and go
t
 your badge. The executives will move from room to room. They'll spend about 20 minutes in each room. Every executive will come through. So George will be by himself. Everyone else will be paired up. We'll give you opportunity to ask them more questions a
nd have a little bit of more informal interaction time with them. \line 
So again, lunch is available in the buffet outside and then another buffet by the room that's slightly further away. Please grab your food, get settled, and then the execs will come around and chat with you. Thank you very much. \line \sect
